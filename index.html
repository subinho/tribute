<h3> Who Is Elon Musk? </h3>

<p>  Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and businessman who</p>
<p>  founded X.com in 1999 (which later became PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and</p>
<p>  Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he</p>
<p>  sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers.</p>

<p>  Musk made headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that would send</p>
<p>  the first commercial vehicle to the International Space Station. He bolstered</p>
<p>  his portfolio with the purchase of SolarCity in 2016, and cemented his standing</p>
<p>  as a leader of industry by taking on an advisory role in the early</p>
<p>  days of President Donald Trump's administration.</p>
